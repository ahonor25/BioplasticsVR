## Welcome to BioplasticsVR

This is a virtual reality game displaying the process and effects of bioplastics! It incorporates some fun game elements to the education part, and is open-source. You can get the source code by going to the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/ahonor25/BioplasticsVR), which lets you change the game, and modify anything you want.

This game is currently being developed for the Oculus Go, Oculus Quest, and Oculus Quest 2. Do we not have your device? Fill out this form, and if there's a lot of users who are also using your headset, I will start developing it for you.
